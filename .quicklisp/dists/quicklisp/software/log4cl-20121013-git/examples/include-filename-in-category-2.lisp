;; If you had run include-filename-in-category-1 example, you may have noticed that
;; if you use SLIME C-c C-c key to recompile the TEST function, the category name
;; that it logs to changes from
;; 
;; [11:53:33] [ info] <example-1:include-file-name-in-category-1:test>
;;   * Hello World
;;
;; to something like
;;
;; [11:58:04] [ info] <example-1:fileny25yx:test>
;;   * Hello World
;;
;; This is because on SBCL when you press C-c C-c, Slime puts the form
;; into a temporary file, such as /tmp/fileny25yx and compiles that.
;;
;; Its possible to fix it, by patching Slime's
;; COMPILE-STRING-FOR-EMACS function to bind the filename the form
;; comes from to a variable, and reference that in our PACKAGE-WRAPPER
;; method
;;
;; Below example shows how to do it.
;;
;; The code between the (IN-PACKAGE :SWANK) and (IN-PACKAGE
;; :EXAMPLE-2) can be put into ~/.swank.lisp initialization file, so
;; it can be reused in multiple systems and packages
;;
