For russian-speaking users there is russian localization, it was tested with sbcl and changes strings to russian equivalents during compiling, so it may be tricky and needs recompiling code (I just remove needed directory from ~/.cache/common-lisp/sbcl-* and compile source).
To use it uncomment 

;(load "globalization-macros.lisp")

string in media-library.sbclrc
